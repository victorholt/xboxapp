To get this to work locally please ensure you have NodeJS installed on your machine.

Go to the **/src/** folder and run

```javascript

```javascript
node server/server.js
```
To get the webserver running. The site by default should run at the location: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
You may change the port # by going the the **server/config.json** file and updating the port.

###The code
The code base is broken up in the following way:

1. **/public**
  - The frontend code is compiled into the folders **/js** and **/css** for the javascript files and the css files.
2. **/src**
  - All of the source code include the **Gruntfile.js** file is included here.

###Source Code File Structure
The code file structure is done in the following manner:

```javascript
/src
	/server - All of the server-related files
	/site 	- All site-related files
		/components - ReactJS 'view' components
		/core 		- Core files that 'core' functionality outside of the views (ReactJS)
		/sass 		- Sass files
```
